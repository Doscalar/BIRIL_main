# Deep Spiking Neural Network with Brain-Inspired Recurrent Iterative Learning (BIRIL)

![BIRIL Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=BIRIL+Architecture+Diagram)

Official implementation of the paper **"Deep Spiking Neural Network with Brain-Inspired Recurrent Iterative Learning"** - a novel hybrid learning framework that synergistically integrates biologically realistic spike transmission with adaptive excitation-inhibition dynamics.

## üîç Overview

BIRIL is a brain-inspired training framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that:
- Emulates biological excitation-inhibition balance (‚àº4:1 ratio)
- Combines STDP-based local learning with STBP-based global learning
- Dynamically adjusts neuronal activity through a three-cycle training strategy
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with low computational overhead

```python
# Core training mechanism
def train_BIRIL():
    excitation_cycle = simulate_biological_excitation()
    inhibition_cycle = apply_neural_inhibition()
    hybrid_cycle = integrate_ei_balance()
    return optimize_network(electro-chemical_conversion)
